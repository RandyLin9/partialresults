						ecosystem in 2022
					</h2> -->

					<p>HONG KONG - With the digital innovation in the financial industry, the Mandatory Provident Fund
						Schemes Authority (MPFA) has announced the launch of eMPF, a ‘paper-less’ and streamlined online
						platform for processing MPF.
					</p>

					<p>On 26 November, the MPFA held the “MPF e-Tools Experience Day” at the Hong Kong Convention and
						Exhibition Centre, aiming to provide a sneak peek about the MPFA to the public before officially
						launching in 2022.
					</p>

					<p>This move is considered to be one of the largest transformations of the MPF, the MPFA hopes its
						users will have a more user-friendly experience. Currently, there are about 2,639,000 users
						covered under the MPF scheme, which accounts for 74 per cent of the employed population.
					</p>

					<script>!function (e, i, n, s) { var t = "InfogramEmbeds", d = e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; if (window[t] && window[t].initialized) window[t].process && window[t].process(); else if (!e.getElementById(n)) { var o = e.createElement("script"); o.async = 1, o.id = n, o.src = "https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js", d.parentNode.insertBefore(o, d) } }(document, 0, "infogram-async");</script>

					<p>“It will digitally handle MPF instead of filling out forms, doing human resources management, and
						even wage earners have many benefits,” said Alice Law, the Deputy Chairman and Managing Director
						of MPFA in the event.
					</p>

					<p>This e-platform will let its members use MPF via the internet’s one-stop service, avoiding
						repetitive processes and improving work efficiency. Last year, the MPFA issued fines to over
						200,000 employers who are overdue or owed contributions.
					</p>

					<p>“I think the government should have done it before, I don’t like the feeling of checking the
						mailbox every day,” said Ms Ngan, a cleaning services company owner.
					</p>

					<p>Users will have a ‘one-click’ approach to see where accounts are within the 45 years in the
						system, which is in part due to a common criticism of the MPF not only having higher fees but
						users having to wait 2-3 weeks to transfer and consolidate accounts.
					</p>

					<p>With the ambition of promoting Hong Kong as a smart city, the Hong Kong government has been
						launching several projects such as the Faster Payment System (FPS). But not all people in Hong
						Kong feel positive about these innovations. </p>

					<p>Since August, many lamp posts were destroyed by protesters concerning the privacy issues, the
						Hong Kong government said in a press release they were only used for city data to facilitate
						smart city development through open data and the upcoming 5G technology.
					</p>

					<p>EMPF platform is also facing challenges of privacy issues by some MPF users.
					</p>

					<p>“I don't think it is safe to process MPF over the internet, because there are no regulations on
						the internet, and your personal information is also on the internet,” said Ms Chan, a telecom
						company employee.
					</p>

					<p>Besides convenience, MPFA also hopes this progress can make Hong Kong an eco-friendly city.
						According to the MPFA, they used up to 70 million pieces of paper for handling the MPF
						administration in 2018, which correlates to about cutting 8,000 trees annually under the current
						administration.
					</p>

					<p>“So today we are ‘five parties together’ to promote the ‘digital transformation’ of MPF. For
						companies, employees, and our planet, we can create a ‘three wins’,” said Law.
					</p>

					<p>In May, the Legislative Council has already approved the budget of about HK$ 3.3 billion for the
						development of the eMPF platform.

						<p>Hong Kong has the longest life span for men and women in the world. The retirement life for
							an individual could presumably last for more than 20 years. Therefore, a retirement plan
							should always refer back to the latest expenses, like daily expenses and medical expenses.

						<p>For most people, the first thing they need to deal with when joining a new company is MPF.
							MPF is a compulsory retirement scheme created by the Hong Kong government in 2000. Most
							employees and employers are required to contribute monthly to MPF schemes.
						</p>

						<p>Except for a small number of people exempted, Hong Kong employed people aged 18 to 65 must be
							required to join MPF schemes. Both employers and employees make joint contributions to
							establish a fund. To get contributions for retirement, employees must reach the age of 65 or
							for a specific reason under normal circumstances. In 2014, citizens aged 65 and above made
							up 15 per cent of the total population. This demographic is predicted to increase by 28 per
							cent by 2034, followed by 33 per cent by 2064.
						</p>

						<p>Before MPF, only about one-third of the working population had retirement protection. Now, 85
							per cent- more than half of the working population has retirement protection.

						<p>The ORSO scheme provide employee benefits for some large-scale institutions generally -
							provide retirement benefits through the provident fund and increase employees’ sense of
							belonging - before the establishment of the MPF system.
						</p>

						<p>Kenny Wen, the investment manager of Everbright Sun Hung Kai, said if the future eMPF
							platform doesn’t include ORSO schemes, it is believed that this will lead to a further flow
							of related users to MPF schemes.
						</p>

						<p>“It is estimated that MPF will attract more ORSO users even if there is no such centralized
							MPF platform,'' said Kenny, “I noticed that some companies provide both MPF and ORSO for
							employees to choose.”
						</p>

						<p>Jessica, who worked as a marketing executive at a world-wide company, participated in the
							ORSO schemes for nearly 20 years, “The company would help their employee to pay 15% of their
							salary, but she was willing to pay 10 more per cent as the preparation of her future
							retirement plan.”
						</p>

						<p>She evaluated the performance of ORSO scheme and amid that returns were not satisfactory.
						</p>

						<p>“The equity market this year is performing well, leading to the rise of investment return
							level. In contrast, the returns of ORSO were even lower than that of the saving account,
							which only contributes 1% raise per year in the past two decades,” Jessica added, "Due to
							the convenience of eMPF, I may invest more money on it."
						</p>

						<p>Kenny further stated, the launching of eMPF helps to enhance the efficiency of the
							administrative works and makes it more user-friendly for both employers and employees.
